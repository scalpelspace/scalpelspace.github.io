### 2.6 Power Supply

The board can be powered by either of the following methods:

1. 5V pin via the Uno-style interface.
2. Onboard USB-C connector.

#### 2.6.1 5 V Power OR Switch

The 5 V supply is managed by an OR power switch (TPS2116DRL).

The `5V` pin from the Uno-style interface takes priority. As long as ~1 V or
more is present on this pin, it will be used as the power source. If this
condition is not met, the board automatically switches to the USB-C 5 V supply.

#### 2.6.2 Optional 5 V Pin Supply Protection

The `5V` pin supply can be configured with optional protection diodes (default
not included), see the following instructions:

- The `5 V bypass` jumper must be cut to stop shorting of the schottky diode
  pads, enforcing the schottky diode.
- Schottky diode required (designator `D1`, footprint SMA).
    - Intended to provide reverse polarity protection.
- TVS diode required (designator `D2`, footprint SMB).
    - Intended to provide short high voltage clamping.

#### 2.6.3 3.3 V LDO Supply

The 3.3 V supply is managed onboard by a dedicated 5 V to 3.3 V LDO, independent
of any connected board.

If the user wishes to use the Momentum dev board's 3.3 V supply for low current
applications, the `Interface 3.3 V output` jumper can be bridged, allowing for
3.3 V to be supplied from the onboard LDO. This should only be done with
caution, as a connected main controller which would supply its own 3.3 V on the
same Uno-style interface `3.3V` output pin.

### 2.7 SPI Interface

All SPI pins interfacing with connected boards are level-shifted. By default,
the external SPI pins are level shifted to 5 V. However, it can also be shifted
to 3.3 V via the `Level shifter V IO` 3-pad jumper.

> See section [2.8 Level Shifter](#28-level-shifter) for details.

The SPI CS pin can be swapped between the Uno-style interface pins `D10`
(default) and `D8` via the `Interface SPI CS pin select` jumper. This is
intended to help resolve any pin conflicts.

### 2.8 Level Shifter

Note the level shifter interfaces with the SPI singals (CIPO, COPI, SCK and CS)
as well as the WS2812B PWM data line. Adjusting the `Level shifter V IO` 3-pad
jumper toggles the voltage shifting between 3.3 V and 5 V.

If you opt for 3.3 V shifting, be aware that the **WS2812B LED may exhibit
instability**. The WS2812B datasheet states:

1. DIN high signal >= 0.7 * VDD
2. DIN low <= 0.3 * VDD

Thus, a 3.3 V signal may not be able to meet the DIN high requirement, reducing
functionality of the WS2812B in this level shifting configuration.

### 2.9 STM32L432KC Flashing

The official STM32L432KC Momentum firmware is managed
here: [`momentum`](https://github.com/scalpelspace/momentum).

The STM32L432KC can be flashed in 3 different ways:

1. SWD via Tag-Connect TC2050 interface.
2. Hands-free UART bootloader via USB-C (CP2102N USB-to-UART).
3. Manual BOOT0 jumper with UART bootloader via USB-C (CP2102N USB-to-UART).

For use of the USB-C UART bootloader interface, the custom flashing
software [`pyblasher`](https://github.com/scalpelspace/pyblasher) is highly
recommended.

All three options are available by default, however it is **suggested to use
options 1 and 2** based on user preference.

**Option 3** is applicable for users who wish to use the USB-C for as both a
serial and UART bootloader interface. In this method, the through-hole
`BOOT0 jumper` must be manually bridged to assert BOOT0.

> See section [2.10 USB-C Serial Interface](#210-usb-c-serial-interface) for
> details.

### 2.10 USB-C Serial Interface

The USB-C interface connected via the CP2102N USB-to-UART is primarily designed
as a UART bootloader flashing interface, however can also be used as a serial
interface for simple communication to a desktop computer.

Due to the design for hands-free flashing, the STM32's BOOT0 will be controlled
by the CP2102N's DTR pin. Thus, when a COM port is established BOOT0 will be
raised high, entering the bootloader. To prevent this behaviour, the
`BOOT0 DTR bridge` jumper can be cut, allowing for USB-C serial communication.

If the user wishes to still use the UART bootloader with this modification, the
BOOT0 must be asserted manually to enter the bootloader via the through-hole
`BOOT0 jumper`.
